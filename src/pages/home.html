<h2>Communitas Hospitii</h2>
<p>Welcome! We live by the ancient philosophy of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospitium" target="_blank">Hospitium</a>, the divine right of guests and the divine duty of the host.</p>
<p>We will be operating a hostel, a bed and breakfast, and a number of Airbnbs.</p>
