<h2>About Us</h2>
<p>Welcome! We live by the ancient philosophy of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospitium" target="_blank">Hospitium</a>, the divine right of guests and the divine duty of the host.</p>

<p>Our plan is to start by opening our first Airbnb in the mountains of North Carolina. Please consider <a href="https://paypal.me/communiotemplorum" target="_blank">donating</a> to help us save for the investment.</p>

<p>We are also taking applications for any interested potential members. Please review our <a href="#!/articles/">Articles of Incorporation</a> before applying.</p>
